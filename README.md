## Suggested Hosting & Services

**Zero-Cost** is achievable for using this template. Here are all the services used in the demo website:

- Platform services (Pages, Workers, D1, KV, R2, Turnstile) are free to use. Queues requires the Workers paid plan ($5/month), but you can avoid using it by disabling the error logging feature.

- [Resend](https://resend.com/) Email API: Free plan can support up to 3000 emails per month (100 emails per day) and one custom domain which is enough for small websites. You may consider upgrading to Pro plan if you need more. And you can also replace it with other email services, it's very easy to modify the code.

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/): Free to use, only charge when you make money. You can use the test mode for development and testing.

- [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/) (optional): Error notification can be sent to Lark group chat and notify the team members. You can avoid using it by disabling the error logging feature. The starter free plan can support up 50 team members, which is enough for small companies. 

## Quick Start

### Get Started (Local Development)

To get started, create your own copy of the project for development. There are two options:
- Fork this repository to your GitHub if you want to contribute some or all of your work back to this public open source project. It will keep the full commit history, and be easier to create PRs back to this project. Contributions and issues are always welcome.
- Clone or download the repository to your machine if you want to keep your work private.

Run the following commands locally in the terminal:

```
# assume the project folder (sveltekit-cloudflare-template) is ready in your machine
$ cd sveltekit-cloudflare-template
# install dependencies (assume you have Node.js installed)
$ npm install
# all the dependencies will be installed including wrangler CLI
```

Then, prepare and create the necessary services:

- Create [Resend](https://resend.com/) email service and get the API key (for `RESEND_API_KEY`), refer to [Setup Resend Email API section](#setup-resend-email-api).
- Create [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account and get the API key (for `PRIVATE_STRIPE_API_KEY`), refer to [Setup Stripe Billing section](#setup-stripe-billing).
- Prepare a local D1 database and tables:
  
  ```
  # read all comments explained in example-wrangler.toml file before proceeding
  # create a new D1 database named example_db using wrangler CLI
  $ npx wrangler d1 create example_db
  # create all the necessary tables in the local example_db database
  $ npx wrangler d1 execute example_db --local --file=./db_schema/schema.sql
  ```

Next, prepare the environment variables and configuration files:

```
# create an env file from the example
$ cp example.dev.vars .dev.vars
# manually change the values in the .dev.vars file
# JWT secret should be at least 32 characters long and randomly generated
# LARK_BOT_URL and STRIPE_WH_SECRET can be empty or anything for development
# APP_ENV, TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY and NODE_VERSION can be kept as they are

# create a wrangler.toml file from the example
$ cp example.wrangler.toml wrangler.toml

# change configurations in /src/config.js
# you need to change WEBSITE_NAME, APP_DOMAIN, WEBSITE_DESCRIPTION variables
```

Finally, there are two methods to run the project locally:

```
# Method 1 (recommended and sufficient):
# start the development server powered by Vite
$ npm run dev -- --host
# access it at http://localhost:5173 in local machine
# or access it at http://<machine-ip>:5173 in local network
# "dev = true" in this method (import { dev } from "$app/environment";)
# local ENV, KV, D1 will be used
# it's good to use this method for development in most cases

# Method 2:
# build the project
$ npm run build
# .svelte-kit/cloudflare/ will be generated after the build
# start the pages dev server powered by wrangler
$ npx wrangler pages dev --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8787 --live-reload .\.svelte-kit\cloudflare\
# access the website at http://localhost:8787 or http://<machine-ip>:8787
# "dev = false" in this method (import { dev } from "$app/environment";)
# local ENV, KV, D1 will be used
```

For the local development, error logging feature is not available, because you can see all the logs in the terminal. Error logging feature is only available in the production environment, and it requires Queues, R2 Storage and Lark Bot Webhook services.

To deploy the website live, follow the below steps to do the necessary setup.

### Setup Platform

- Create an account and add (or buy) a domain (eg, `justincase.top`). Free plan is ok, but a Worker paid plan ($5/month) is required for error logging feature (optional, can be disabled).

- Create two new KV namespaces named `login_session_cache` and `rate_limit` via the dashboard or wrangler CLI.

- Setup D1 database
  - Create a new D1 database named `example_db` via the dashboard or wrangler CLI.
  - Create all the tables in `example_db` database. You can use the `/db_schema/schema.sql` file to create the tables. It's recommended to do it in Wrangler CLI, as it's more convenient and efficient. Here is the command (execute it in the project root directory): `npx wrangler d1 execute example_db --remote --file=./db_schema/schema.sql`.

- Setup Queues (optional)
  - Create a new R2 bucket named `error-bucket` via the dashboard, it's used for storing error logs.
  - Create a new Queue named `error-queue` via the dashboard, it's used for queuing error logs processing.
  - Create a worker (consumer worker) to consume the error logs from the queue. You can use the Worker project in the `/workers/error_logger` directory. Just execute the command `npx wrangler deploy` in the `/workers/error_logger` directory to deploy the worker. All the necessary bindings are done in the `/workers/error_logger/wrangler.toml` file, no need to bind them in the dashboard again.

- Setup Turnstile CAPTCHA
  - Add the website (eg, `justincase.top`) to Turnstile in the dashboard. You can use the default settings, or customize it as you like.
  - Get the site key and secret key, change the site key (ok to public) in `get_turnstile_sitekey()` function of `/src/config.js` file, and add the secret key (keep it secure) as an environment variable `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` in the dashboard for production.

### Setup Resend Email API

- Create a [Resend](https://resend.com/) account, free plan is good.

- Add your domain (eg, `justincase.top`) in the Resend dashboard and set the required DNS records in the dashboard. Here I use the subdomain `mail.justincase.top` for email sending.

- Create an API key in the Resend dashboard, and add it as an environment variable `RESEND_API_KEY` in (`.dev.vars` file locally, and in the dashboard for production).

### Setup Lark Bot Webhook (Optional)

The Lark bot webhook is for error log notification feature. This is optional, you can disable error logging by setting `ENABLE_ERROR_LOGGING` to `false` in `/src/config.js` file. You can also replace it with other services easily, such as Slack, Discord, etc. But I have to say Lark is wonderful.

- Create a [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/) account, free plan is good.

- Create a group chat in Lark and [add the Lark bot to the group chat](https://www.larksuite.com/hc/en-US/articles/360048487736-use-bots-in-groups).

- [Get the webhook URL in the Lark bot settings](https://open.larksuite.com/document/client-docs/bot-v3/add-custom-bot), and add it as an environment variable `LARK_BOT_URL` in the dashboard for production. Keep the webhook URL secure.

### Setup Stripe Billing

- Create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account.

- Create a product and price Tiers
  - Create your [products](https://stripe.com/docs/api/products) and their [prices](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices) in the dashboard or with the Stripe CLI.
  - This template works best if you define each tier as a separate product (eg, `Just In Case Free`, `Just In Case Pro`, `Just In Case Enterprise`). Include a monthly and annual price for each product if you want to support multiple billing periods.
  - You do not need to create a free plan in Stripe. The free plan is managed within the app.
  - Add pricing descriptions in dashboard for different prices to help you identify the product in the code better (eg,`Pro Monthly Subscription`, `Pro Yearly Subscription`, `Enterprise Monthly Subscription`, `Enterprise Yearly Subscription`). You can do it in this way: `Product catalog > Edit product (you want to add description for) > (find pricing option) Edit price > Advanced > Price description`.

- Setup your Stripe API key
  - Get your [Secret API](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) key, and add it as an environment variable `PRIVATE_STRIPE_API_KEY` in (`.dev.vars` file locally, and in the dashboard for production). Be sure to use test keys for development, and keep your production keys secret and secure.

- Setup your Stripe Webhook
  - Add your [Stripe webhook endpoint](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks). Here I use `https://justincase.top/api/stripe-webhooks` for the webhook endpoint as an example. You can use your own domain and path. Select the events you want to listen to, here I use `invoice.paid` event to trigger the webhook, so the subscription status in database will be updated immediately after the renewal payment is successful, check the related code in `/src/routes/(admin)/api/stripe-webhooks/+server.js` file.
  - Once the endpoint is created, you can reveal the signing secret in the webhook page. Add the webhook signing secret as an environment variable `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` in the dashboard for production.
- Optional: theme your Stripe integration
  - [Customize your brand](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding) for Stripe Checkout and Portal pages. You can change the logo, colors, and more.
- Update your pricing plan data to align to your stripe data
  - See `/src/routes/(public)/pricing/pricing_plans.js` and fill in all fields for each plan. `stripe_price_id` and `stripe_product_id` should only be omitted on a single “free” plan. Multiple free plans are not supported.
  - The product in Stripe can contain several prices for the same product (annual, monthly, etc). The `stripe_price_id` you choose to put in this json will be the default we use for the checkout experience. However, if you have more prices configured for a product configured, the user can switch between them in the management portal.
  - Set the `default_plan_id` to the plan the user will see as their “current plan” after signup, but before subscribing to a paid plan (typically “free”). It should align to the plan with no `stripe_price_id`.
  - if you want an item highlighted on pricing page, specify that plan id in `/src/routes/(public)/pricing/+page.svelte`
- Update your portal configuration
  - Open [stripe portal config](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal) and make the following changes
    - Disallow editing email under customer information
    - Optional: [setup a custom domain](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains) (not free, $10/month) so Stripe pages use your own domain , recommended for real production use.
- Repeat steps in production environment.

### Deployment

This template is designed to be deployed on Pages, not on Vercel, Netlify, or other platforms.

Follow the platform documentation and [SvelteKit's documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-cloudflare) to deploy it in a few clicks. Be sure to select “SvelteKit” as framework, and the rest of the defaults will work.

When prompted: add environment variables for your production environment, you have got the values from the previous steps. 

```
APP_ENV = production
NODE_VERSION = 20
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY = ...      # secret key for Turnstile CAPTCHA
RESEND_API_KEY = ...            # Resend email API key
PRIVATE_STRIPE_API_KEY = ...    # Stripe API secret key
STRIPE_WH_SECRET =...           # Stripe webhook signing secret
LARK_BOT_URL = ...              # Lark bot webhook URL, NOT required if error logging is disabled
VERIFY_EMAIL_JWT_SECRET = ...   # JWT secret for email verification
LOGIN_JWT_SECRET = ...          # JWT secret for login auth
MAGIC_LINK_JWT_SECRET = ...     # JWT secret for magic link login
RESET_PWD_JWT_SECRET = ...      # JWT secret for reset password
ONSITE_API_JWT_SECRET = ...     # JWT secret for onsite API auth
```

You should [generate](https://delinea.com/resources/password-generator-it-tool) an at least 32 characters long random string for each JWT secret and keep them secure.

Once first deployment is done, the website is still not fully functional. You need to bind the KV, D1, Queues services to the website in the dashboard. You can do it in this way: `Pages > your website > Settings > Functions > KV namespace bindings / D1 database bindings / Queue Producers bindings > Add binding`.

```
KV namespace bindings:
  LOGIN_SESSION_CACHE -> login_session_cache
  RATE_LIMIT -> rate_limit
D1 database bindings:
  DB -> example_db
Queue Producers bindings (required if you want to use error logging feature):
  ERROR_QUEUE -> error-queue
```

After binding the services, you need the retry deployment to make everything reload. Now the website should be fully functional and live. The website will update automatically when you push new code to the main branch in GitHub.

Optional: enable analytics in the dashboard for usage metrics.

### Add your content!

After the steps above, you’ll have a working version like the demo page. However, it’s not branded, and doesn’t have your content. The following checklist helps you customize the template to make a website for your company.

- Describe your site with a name, description and base URL in in `/src/config.js:`. These values are used for SEO.
- Content
  - Add actual content for homepage to make it specific to your product or service.
  - Add actual content for your blog (or delete the blog)
    - Update all fields in `/src/routes/(public)/blog/posts.js`, and replace the post pages under `/src/routes/(public)/blog/posts` to align to the urls from `posts.js`.
    - Alternatively remove the blog by removing the `/src/routes/(public)/blog` directory, and remove any links to the blog in the header and footer. You can always bring it back later.
  - Add any pages you want on top of our boiler plate (about, privacy, etc). Be sure to add links to them in the header, mobile menu header, and footer as appropriate (`/src/routes/(public)/+layout.svelte`).
- Update SEO content
  - Update title and meta description tags for every public page. We include generic ones using your site name (`/src/config.js`), but the more specific these are the better.
  - This done automatically for blog posts from `posts.js` metadata.
- Style
  - Create a new DaisyUI Theme matching your brand or use one of the built in [themes from DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/) (see `tailwind.config.js`)
  - Update the homepage layout `/src/routes/(public)/+layout.svelte`: customize design, delete unwanted pages from header and footer
  - Style: make it your own look and feel.
  - Update the favicon and other logo files in the `/static/` directory.
- Functionality
  - Add actual functionality for your service.
  - Replace the dashboard with real content (`/src/routes/(admin)/dashboard/(menu)/+page.svelte`).
  - Add necessary documentation pages for your service.

## Credits

Part of the UI and documentation for this project is originally from [CMSaasStarter](https://github.com/CriticalMoments/CMSaasStarter), which I have modified and enhanced with new features. While CMSaasStarter uses services from Supabase, I have replaced them with alternative services and implemented different logic. If you prefer to use Supabase, you can check out the original project, which is also a great choice.
