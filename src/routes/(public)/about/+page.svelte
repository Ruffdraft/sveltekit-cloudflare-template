    <p>
      Tentrait Ltd develops intelligent tools that simplify complex infrastructure challenges — from OT-aware packet analysis to secure access segmentation and scalable SaaS platforms. Built on modern cloud architecture, our solutions empower organisations to visualise, secure, and optimise their operations without disruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      We help UK organisations comply with the latest IT/OT security objectives published by the UK government, reducing the risk of costly penalties for non-compliance.

    <h2 class="font-bold mt-8 mb-4">About Tentrait Ltd</h2>
    <p>
      Tentrait Ltd is a UK-based technology company focused on building innovative tools at the intersection of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT). We serve SMEs and industrial organisations seeking pragmatic, secure, and scalable solutions that don’t compromise uptime or visibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded by infrastructure and cybersecurity specialists, Tentrait develops practical, intelligence-driven applications designed to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhance visibility across hybrid OT/IT networks</li>
      <li>Simplify secure access for remote users and vendors</li>
      <li>Reduce risk through passive analysis and anomaly detection</li>
      <li>Offer modern UX and automation for legacy-heavy environments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What We Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Smart Infrastructure Tools</strong> – We build tooling that lets operators understand what’s on their network, how devices interact, and where risks may be hiding — all from PCAP uploads or live data sources.</li>
      <li><strong>IT/OT Security Solutions</strong> – From VPN segmentation and zero-trust access control to industrial protocol detection, we design systems that secure industrial environments without interfering with operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable SaaS Platforms</strong> – Our products are cloud-native, lightweight, and deployable across teams, with integrations for Microsoft 365, Cloudflare, HubSpot, and more.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics-First Design</strong> – We bring enterprise-grade visibility to environments that lack monitoring, using intuitive dashboards and automation built for speed and clarity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Flagship Features</h2>
    <p><strong>Zentra Discovery Pack</strong> – A rapid network insight bundle for manufacturers, energy companies, and other OT-heavy environments. Upload PCAP files and get actionable maps, protocol insights, and suspicious behavior alerts — all in minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Access Segmentation for Remote Work</strong> – Identity-based VPN segmentation to ensure every vendor, team, or site has access only to what they need. No more flat networks.</p>
    <p><strong>Cloud-Edge Architecture</strong> – Every product we build is hosted securely via Cloudflare Pages, KV, and Workers — ensuring low latency, global availability, and resilience by design.</p>
